# Heart_disease_decision
This code classifies heart disease diagnosed versus no heart disease diagnosed using supervised machine learning with a tool called decision trees. Decision trees are predictive models that use a set of binary rules to calculate a target value. Each individual tree has a root node, decision nodes, branches and leaves.
The dataset is heart_decision.csv file also uploaded here with the variables as explained.
variables are:
· chol — serum cholesterol in mg/dl
· restecg — resting electrocardiographic results
o 0: normal
o 1: having ST-T wave abnormality
o Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy
· target — have disease or not (1 = yes, 0=no).
Instructions
download the dataset.
You will need python3 installed and an IDE of your choice, I used Jupiter notebook as my IDE
Download the Heart_decision_python_code and open it with the IDE...
Run all the codes in it as see how it works

Thanks
